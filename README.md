Plasma-netctl
----------
This is a plasma applet that for the moment displays some information about the connected network with focus on the wireless connection. The icon changes according to the signal strength. 

The plan is to make it show some useful information about the connected network, and also show the available networks in the area. In time it would be nice to make it able to switch the network using netctl-auto.
